This `DaemonSet` provides metrics in Prometheus format about disk usage on the nodes.
The container `read-du` reads in sizes of all directories below /mnt and writes that to `/tmp/metrics`. It only reports directories larger then `100M` for now.
The other container `caddy` just hands out the contents of that file on request via `http` on `/metrics` at port `9102` which are the defaults for Prometheus.
These are scheduled on every node in the Kubernetes cluster.
To choose directories from the node to check, just mount them on the `read-du` container below `/mnt`.
